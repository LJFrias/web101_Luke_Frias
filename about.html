            <h2>Hi! I'm Luke!</h2>
            <p>I'm currently a student at the prestigious school of web development Austin Coding Academy. I have exactly zero experience with coding, other then my current knowledge from the course. Honestly I am just trying to fill space in this section in order to see how my about me page will look with this word count. I'll just talk about some hobbies and interest. First thing is first, I LOVE video games, but when I am not gaming my life away I enjoy speding time with my fiance and friends. Some of the activities we do is camping, going out to eat, and working on our cars.</p>
